This repo contains analogtv-cli tool from [XScreensaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) by [Jamie Zawinski](jwz.org) and the team stripped to the minimum required files to run.

It imitates old TV so well that I always wanted to have this as a filter.

Build:
Run `python3 gen_build.py > build.sh` script and run resulting script.

TODO:
* build it with CMake
* strip more extra files
* transform this code to a platform-independent shader-like filter
